# breadth-first-search-algorithm
The system is a dungeon, with M representing the number of rows and N representing the number of columns. There is a princess imprisoned in the bottom-right corner, waiting for the Knight in the top-left of the dungeon to rescue her. The main goal of the project is to save the princess. The system uses the dungeon floor map as input, as well as the number of obstacles to be removed (optional). The system calculates the shortest distance between the top left room where the knight is located and the bottom right room where the princess is imprisoned. We devised a solution based on the Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to save the princess.
